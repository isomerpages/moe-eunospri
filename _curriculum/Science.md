**Our beliefs and philosophy about Science education**  
We believe that every child is curious has an innate passion for Science. Through our love for Science, we aim to nurture every child to be an inquirer who is a passionate and independent thinker of Science.  
  
In Eunos Primary School, we strongly believe that Science is best taught through fun, authentic and hands-on experiences. Apart from engaging the mind through inquiry, we believe that engaging the heart and body are equally as important in the learning process.&nbsp;  
  
Core to our philosophy of Science education is our commitment to environmental education. Synonymous with our school value of ‘Care’, we firmly believe that every child can do their part to care for their environment. From learning about conservation in the zoo to using recyclables in our experiments, every child will have the opportunity to do their part in protecting the environment in the school. We hope that in time to come, our students will be able to apply their knowledge of Science to solve our environmental problems of the present and the future.

**Programmes and Activities**

_Giving your child the breadth of experiences…_

In Eunos Primary School, our Science curriculum emphasises the importance of the environment as the “third” teacher. Through authentic learning experiences in immersive learning environments, we seek to help our students draw connections between topics and subjects...

_Science Trail@Eunos Boulevard_&nbsp;\-&nbsp;At the heart of our school is a garden we call the Eunos Boulevard. The garden hosts a wide variety of plants, including our native endangered plants that we are hosting as part of NPark’s Greening Schools for Biodiversity Programme. We have an interactive Science Trail designed for P3-6 students that introduce the various types and uses of the plants. In addition, the boulevard is used for our P1 and 2 PAL programme for Outdoor Learning.  
  
_Kitchen Chemistry_&nbsp;– One of our highlights of our post-examination activities is Kitchen Chemistry, where our students learn about the Science behind cooking and make their own food. From learning about the changes of states of matter by making popsicles to learning about decomposers and methods of food preservation, students will have the chance to learn, make and taste their own food.  
  
_P4 Zoo Camp&nbsp;–_&nbsp;Our Primary 4 Zoo Camp is one of our school’s signature programme for the cohort. Every Primary 4 student would experience a 2 day 1 night camp at the Singapore Zoo, learning about the importance of conservation and building stronger bonds between their classmates and teachers.  
  
The camp will also give students a rare opportunity to go behind the scenes to see how the food for zoo animals are prepared and how sick animals are treated in the zoo’s medical facilities. Following that, students will apply their learning and experiences in their Project work task on conservation and the depth of learning.

We believe that learning is the deepest when there is an authentic application of learning. Apart from in-class teaching and practice of questions that test conceptual understanding, all our students go through several challenging applied projects to reinforce their understanding of Science concepts. As the projects are challenging in nature, each student is likely to fail in the first attempt, reflect on his/her mistake and re-attempt the task. We believe that constructive failure is as valuable a learning outcome as success in the learning process.  

_The joy of teaching brings about the joy of learning._

We strongly believe that having motivated teachers who have a deep love for Science is key to having an exciting and engaging Science learning experience. Thus, as a department, we invest heavily in growing our teachers through courses, professional learning teams and curriculum review and innovation projects. In our efforts to constantly improve our programme, our teachers regularly share ideas with other educators at various platforms and bring back fresh learning to the school.  
  
In 2016, we presented a paper at the 12th International Conference of the Learning Sciences on our work on improving Assessment for Learning in the form of pop quizzes. In 2017, we presented a paper at the Redesigning Pedagogy International Conference hosted by NIE on our work on tiered multiple-choice questions and improving feedback for MCQ questions. In addition, our teachers also share their ideas regularly at the cluster and zonal platforms to refine our programmes for our students.
