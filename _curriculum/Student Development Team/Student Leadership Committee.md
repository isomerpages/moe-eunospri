In Eunos Primary School, we believe that every student can be a self-disciplined leader of service and stewardship. Under the care and mentoring of the teachers, every student can perform at their optimal level in their areas of talents and strengths.

We endeavour to nurture the leadership potential in all our students by providing meaningful leadership roles for them to undertake and providing effective training to equip them to excel in their roles.

**Student Leadership Framework**

In our efforts to provide meaningful leadership roles to the students, the Student Leadership Framework was refined in 2018 to clearly indicate the Student Leadership roles which are available for the students to undertake.

| **Level 4** | Executive Committee Prefects |
| **Level 3** | Senior Student Peer Supporters, Senior Prefects |
| **Level 2** | Junior Student Peer Supporters, Junior Prefects, NE Ambassadors, Cyberwellness Ambassadors, CCA Leaders |
| **Level 1** | Subject Champs, Class Group Champs |

**Developmental Outcomes**

Recognizing the importance to provide effective leadership training, desired student leadership developmental outcomes were identified for each of the levels. Based on the respective outcomes and leadership focus, customized training is then designed and conducted for all student leaders.
