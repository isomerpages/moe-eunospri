**Reading Programmes in Eunos**

Conducted at the start of EL period on Wednesdays, students are exposed to the different genres of books and are given the opportunity to share the stories they have read through oral and book reviews in class. Primary 4, 5 and 6 students took this platform to read the newspapers and develop personal opinions and views, which in turn enhances their critical understanding of the text read. Through this programme, students are encouraged to read widely and be discerning readers. ‘Mystery Reader’ storytelling sessions at the library are also conducted during recess.

Our school has also embarked on MyON, an online reading portal, which tracks students’ reading progress and generates interest-based book recommendations that are developmentally appropriate.
