At Eunos Primary, we encourage our students to adopt a healthy lifestyle by eating healthily and exercising regularly. We work with our canteen vendors to ensure that the food that they sell adhere to the Healthy Plate initiative by the Health Promotion Board. The meals consist of ¼ plate of Carbohydrates (rice, noodles, bread etc), ¼ plate of Protein (Chicken, Fish etc.) and ½ plate of Fruits and Vegetables. All drinks sold in the canteen and the vending machines have the healthier choice symbol as endorsed by the Health Promotion Board.

We also ensured that our students are actively engaged in Physical Activities through our structured PE lessons, and Modular Sports programme.
