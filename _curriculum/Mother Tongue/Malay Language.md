### Malay Language

#### Information &amp; Programmes


**MT Fortnight 2019**
	
This year’s theme was aligned with Traditional games, traditional food, herbs and traditional crafts.
	
Our main objective is to help our students experience the joy of learning and to nurture an intrinsic motivation towards learning. Thus, various fun and engaging activities were conducted so that students acquire new experiences, knowledge and skills.
	
Games booth was stationed in the hall for the P1 and P2 students where they were introduced to traditional games such as lereng, teng-teng, tapak kuda and kabadi.
	
The upper primary experienced more enriching activities. The P3 students learnt to make traditional kuih such as epok-epok and ondeh-ondeh. The P4 students learnt how to make Kipas pengantin using recycled materials. The P5 students experienced an enriching world of special vegetables that are used as ‘ulam’ and how to make ‘bedak sejuk’ a traditional face powder used by women before. The students benefited from this activity as they learnt the rich Malay culture as well as the rich vocabulary.

#### Hari Raya Celebration 2019

This year Eunos Primary teachers and pupils put up their own concert. The concert was packed with information and performances. Students put up a skit. Through the skit, pupils learnt about Hari Raya Puasa, the food served and the clothes are worn. They also learnt the need to be grateful and forgiving. The concert ended with a dikir barat performed by theP5 Malay pupils and Malay Department teachers playing the percussion. We are grateful to have one of our pupil’s father, Mr Rusli to help and guide us to put up this beautiful performance. We also get the audience to perform dikir barat movements during our performance. It was a joyous occasion.

  
Malay Department has also organised recess activities where pupils learn more about Malay traditional costumes and traditional Hari Raya delicacies. Pupils get to sample some of the traditional cookies.
