##### Primary One SEL Programme

With the release of recommendations that have been proposed by the MTL Review Committee, our MT Department’s existing SEL Reading programme is aligned with the philosophy of learning MTL. The aim is aligned with the school vision of Eunosians being guided by values; they are happy readers and learners of the MTL.

This school-based curriculum is designed by teachers. Teachers read e-books that are rich with values to pupils. SEL values are integrated through activities that accompany the read-aloud sessions. These values include self-awareness, self-management, relationship management, social awareness and responsible decision making. Pupils learn to apply their learning through real life scenarios during these activities. Pupils are actively engaged in book-making, play acting and bookmark making. The teachers have worked out a 3 steps teaching model to conduct the lesson through preparing the lesson together during Time-tabled Time. Application in the real life setting is emphasized during these lessons.
