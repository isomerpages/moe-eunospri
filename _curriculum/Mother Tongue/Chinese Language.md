**Festivals and Celebration**

Chinese New Year concert and Mid-Autumn Festival celebration are avenues for students to learn about Chinese culture, customs and traditions as they immerse in the joyous occasion. This year, there was a splendid performance by the Wushu and Cultural Dance members and a sing-along session led by the lower primary CL students during the Chinese New Year concert. Riddle guessing, mooncake tasting and pomelo peeling competition are highly anticipated activities in the weeklong Mid-Autumn Festival celebration.

**Reading Superstar Programme**

Reading Superstar Programme aims to develop a love and competency in reading in students through a wide variety of text types. By promoting a reading culture in school, students can grow to become an independent learner of the language.

**Buddy Reading Programme**

Buddy Reading Programme engages selected upper primary and lower primary students weekly to develop literacy and to foster a love of reading. The older student interacts with their younger buddy through reading, developing their speaking fluency and confidence while the younger student engages in storytelling experiences.

**Graded Readers Reading Programme**

“New Stars Island” Graded Picture Book Series are used in class to motivate students’ interest in reading and cultivate a good reading habit among students. Students are engaged in post-reading discussions and activities to build their confidence in reading Chinese books.

**Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme**

Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) exposes students to Chinese language-related cultural performances. Every year, identified levels of CL students will have an opportunity to watch Chinese cultural performances at public performance arts venues to learn about Chinese language and culture in an authentic learning environment.

**MT Fortnight**

MT Fortnight creates an environment that encourages students to use and appreciate the heritage and culture associated with their Mother Tongue language. Students will experience thematic enrichment programmes specially curated as they journey through their primary education. We believe that experiential learning will help to strengthen their cultural roots.
