Through Mathematics, we endeavor to inspire every child to be critical thinkers, life-long learners and active contributors of society. We believe that through using up-to-date teaching pedagogies, resources as well as having engaging and competent Mathematics teachers, the students will develop confidence, interest and enjoyment in Mathematics.  
  

**Conceptual Approach to Learning Mathematics**  
In Eunos Primary, students learn mathematical concepts through a series of activities that are scaffolded to develop conceptual understanding. The focus is to provide students the opportunities to learn mathematics through the use of manipulative, doing and participating in activities.  
  

**Conceptual Approach to Problem Solving**  
P1 to P6 students are taught conceptually the different thinking skills, heuristics and model approach to help them solve non-routine questions and higher order questions.  
  

**Holistic Assessment for Primary 1 and Primary 2**  
Assessment is an important aspect of learning and teaching. A key recommendation for Holistic Assessment is to shift the focus of assessment towards building students’ confidence and desire to learn. There is less emphasis on single-point assessment to ease students’ transition into formal schooling. There are no continual and semestral assessments for Primary 1 and Primary 2. The school has gone beyond pen-and-paper testing and adopted multiple assessment modes like journal writing and doing performance tasks.  
  

**Improving Confidence And Numeracy (ICAN)**  
LLow progress learners face one or more of these difficulties learning Mathematics in the classroom e.g. poor language ability, poor memory retention, lack of motivation and lack of fundamental Mathematics concepts and skills (Number and Operations). The ICAN approach is targeted to level up identified low progress learners in improving their confidence and numeracy skills. Teachers use the ICAN framework which consists of 8 guiding principles, topic-specific strategies and general strategies in their classrooms to help students improve their numeracy skills.  
  

**Mathematics Learning Space**  
There is a Mathematics learning space in the school. It was conceptualised with the aim of encouraging our students to be self-directed learners and to reinforce Mathematics concepts taught in the classroom in a fun way. Mathematical facts such as formulae and multiplication tables were painted on the wall and staircases of the learning space. Interactive games such as Sudoku, Equation Wheel Game and Building Tangram Farm were mounted on the wall to excite and reinforce students’ learning through a fun and unstructured manner during recesses and after school.  
  

**Parents Workshop**  
The Mathematics department conducts Mathematics workshops for our parents. This is part of our efforts in engaging parents as parental involvement plays a vital role at all stages in the students’ learning and also in equipping parents with skills and strategies to guide their children through their Mathematics learning.
