### Cyber Wellness @ EPS

Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of the risks&nbsp;

of harmful online behaviours, an awareness of how to protect oneself online and protecting other internet&nbsp; users from negative behaviours.&nbsp;

  

At Eunos Primary School, the education of our young internet users is important to promote a culture of safe and responsible use. Adopting the three principles, “Respect for Self and Others”, “Safe and Responsible Use” and “Positive Peer Influence”, students will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions and take care of their well-being in cyberspace.

The school appoints Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (CWSA) from the upper primary levels to promote key Cyber Wellness messages.
