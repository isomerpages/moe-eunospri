### CCE Department

**Head of Department**  
Mdm Zheng Huimin Sarah ([zheng\_huimin@moe.edu.sg](mailto:zheng_huimin@moe.edu.sg))  
  

Guided by our philosophy “Every Child Can Learn and Achieve in a Caring Environment”, we believe that Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) through the inculcation of sound moral values and equipping of social and emotional competencies will help a child to achieve his/her full potential, academic and otherwise. Our curriculum and programme development is guided by our level outcomes.

| Level | CCE Level Outcomes |
|:---:|:---:|
| P1 | A respectful and curious person who loves learning and interacts well with others |
| P2 | A confident person who has positive self-esteem and cares for others |
| P3 | A responsible and helpful person who embraces diversity |
| P4 | A disciplined and resilient person who is a team player |
| P5 | A pro-active person who strives for excellence and is a concerned citizen |
| P6 | A reflective person who has integrity and contributes actively to society |

Shared leadership in CCE is practised in our school. Through fostering supportive relationships and modelling good character and citizenship values, school leaders, teaching and non-teaching staff, partners and stakeholders are committed to nurture every child in a safe and caring environment that promotes excellence. Students are encouraged to take responsibility for their character and citizenship development through active engagement and regular reflection.
