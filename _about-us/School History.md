### School History

The school occupies the former site of Jalan Eunos and Jalan Daud Primary Schools. It began its first chapter on 3 January 1984 led by then Principal, Mrs Salmah Yunos, with pupils and staff mainly from Jalan Daud and Telok Kurau Primary Schools.  
  
In December 2001, the school was relocated to its holding area at Chai Chee Lane for PRIME. In December 2004, the school then returned to its current locations, greeted by a new campus.
