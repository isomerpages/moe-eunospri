### Principal's Message

  

We warmly welcome our beloved Eunosians back to school for a new year of rich and joyful learning and hope that they had a meaningful and well-rested year-end break.

  

The past 2 years have been truly exceptional in both positive and not so positive ways. We have constantly reminded our Eunosians to always adopt a Growth Mindset, to view challenges as opportunities for growth and the importance of continuing to Care for others through simple words or deeds of kindness. It is indeed during challenging times that our school values of Care, Unity, Respect, Resilience and Integrity hold greater significance as we strive towards Excellence.

  

In 2022, we continue to be committed to provide vibrant and joyful learning experiences for our Eunosians as we prepare for the merger with Telok Kurau Primary in 2023. As a Chinese proverb goes “When the winds of change blow, some people build walls while others build windmills”, it is our hope that all will adopt a positive mindset and be excited by the possibilities from the impending change.

The well-being of our Eunosians continues to be our top priority and we aim to achieve this through the actions captured in the acronym M.A.G.I.C :  helping our students to practise Mindfulness, keep Active, cultivate a heart of Gratitude, develop an Interest and stay Connected to others. 

  

We are indeed thankful for our supportive partners and committed staff. We are certain that this strong partnership will help create 2022 as the most memorable year for all Eunosians!
