### Measures to Manage Dengue Fever

#### Working Together to Prevent Dengue

Dear Parents,

  

In recent weeks, there has been a surge in dengue cases in Singapore. With the warmer months ahead, we can expect the number of cases to rise further unless immediate actions are taken by everyone in the community to remove mosquito breeding habitats.

  

We would like to take this chance to update you on some of the efforts that the school has taken to prevent dengue, and suggest ways of engaging your child further in this.

  

Please find the circular from the school as the attachment in this announcement.

  

Thank you.

  

Mrs Grace Ong  
Principal
