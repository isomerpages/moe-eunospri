Managing Screen Time  
Feeling frustrated with always having to remind your child of the amount of time they are spending on social media? You can consider using this app, [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT208982), which allows you to access real-time reports about how much time your child spends on his/her gadgets, and set limits for what you want to manage.

The videos below will guide you through these features:

\-          [Managing screen time with parental control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAXcyGw8Q2Y)

Refer to this [article](https://www.lifewire.com/check-screen-time-on-android-5069900#:~:text=To%20track%20screen%20time%2C%20go,set%20a%20time%20limit%20%3E%20OK.) that features a similar Screen Time setting if you are an Android user.

To encourage your child to take ownership of managing his/her screen time responsibly, involve him/her in a discussion. Work together to set an agreeable limit for both you and your child. Support your child in this process and review when necessary.
