Parents Gateway is a new digital platform developed by Ministry of Education (MOE) and GovTech to bring greater convenience to parents to perform simple administrative transactions and to stay updated on schools’ programmes and activities.   

  

This enables parents to better support their child in their education journey through closer interactions and communications with schools. Parents will also be able to use this mobile application to stay updated on school’s programme and activities.

##### New Features in Parents Gateway

1\.  **HQ Comms** – A new feature for HQ comms will be available with this release. Authorised HQ users will be able to post messages to all parents using the Parents Gateway app. The message will appear as a pop-up when parents launch the app.

2\. **Editing of Child’s Initials** – Based on parents’ requests to be able to edit/customise their child’s initials in Parents Gateway (because identical children’s initials can be confusing), we have developed the necessary feature to meet this need.

3\.**Improved Push Notifications Details** – Enhancements have been made to provide parents with useful information on push notifications. This will help parents gain better understanding on how they may use the push notification to their benefit.
