**About the Eunos Primary School Choir**

Eunos Primary School Choir was formed in 1998. The intent was to provide a CCA where pupils with vocal talent could hone their skills and build confidence. Since 2007, under the tutelage of our former resident conductor Mr Lim Tiong Kiang, our choir has grown from strength to strength and journeyed a long way. We achieved Silver Awards in the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging (Choir) in 2008, 2010 and 2012. In 2014, the choir was awarded the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.

In 2007, our choir put up its first public performance, “A Celebration of Young Voices – I’d like to teach the world to sing” at Victoria Concert Hall. Thereafter, we performed at the Singapore Botanic Gardens (2008), the MOE Excel Fest (2011) and at the Singapore Flyer (2012). In May 2014, we were invited to perform at the NLB Marine Parade Library as part of its Arts Outreach Programme. On 22 November 2014, in line with our school’s 30th anniversary theme of Reminisce, Rejoice and Reach Out, we held our first public-ticketed concert, the Euni-Voices, at the Arts House.

In 2016, we warmly welcome Ms Angela Lee Sze Ling to join our Eunos family as our resident conductor. Under her baton, we held our second public-ticketed concert, the Euni-Voices II, at Dunman High School Performing Arts Centre.

In 2018, the choir participated in the Singapore International Choral Festival for the first time and attained the Silver award. The choir members also attended a workshop by Mr Bengt Ollen from Sweden.
