In Art Club, students have the opportunity to deepen their learning of the art skills as well as demonstrate their appreciation of the artworks by artists across the world. Students practice art in a conducive and supportive environment that will further nurture their passion for Art. Besides creating individual art pieces, they also learn how to work in a social setting, to build on one another’s strength.
