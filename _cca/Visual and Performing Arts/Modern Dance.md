The International Dance aims to nurture and groom students to excel in and inculcate a love for Dance. It educates students on different dance styles and techniques. Students would greatly improve in their flexibility, coordination, strength and control. At the end of the programme, the student’s discipline, intellectual abilities and understanding will be developed.

Guided by values, our many young talents aim for high standards of achievements in all performances and competitions we participate in.
