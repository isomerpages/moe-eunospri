The International Dance aims to nurture and groom students to excel in and inculcate a love for Dance. It educates students on different dance styles and techniques.&nbsp;Students would greatly improve in their flexibility, coordination, strength and control. At the end of the programme, the studentâ€™s discipline, intellectual abilities and understanding will be developed.

Guided by values, our many young talents aim for high standards of achievements in all performances and competitions we participate in.
