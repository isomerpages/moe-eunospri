**Our Programme**

In Cultural Dance, we teach our students choreography to express their thoughts and feelings through learning varied dance movements. They do so within the disciplineâ€™s unique vocabulary, semantics, and syntax; with ease and grace on stage. The students will also enhance &amp; deepen social ties as they experience a culture which may be different from their own.&nbsp;The students will have a&nbsp;deeper understanding of other cultures through diverse costumes and varied dance movements and&nbsp;appreciate different cultures and their unique forms of expression.
