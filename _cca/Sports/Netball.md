The Eunos Primary School Netball Club is made up of students who have the interest in and passion for playing Netball. On top of teaching the players the rules and strategies in Netball, players will also be instilled with the values of sportsmanship, teamwork, dedication and perseverance.

Outstanding players are selected to form the Senior and Junior school teams. School team players are given extra training every Tuesday afternoon to ensure that they will be well-prepared for the annual East Zone Inter-Primary Schools Netball Championship which commences in March. Throughout the year, they will also be sent for various Netball carnivals where they will be exposed to friendly matches with Netball teams from other schools.
