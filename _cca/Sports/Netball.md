The Eunos Primary School Netball Club is made up of students who have the interest in and passion&nbsp;for playing Netball. On top of teaching the players the rules and strategies in Netball, players will&nbsp;also be instilled with the values of sportsmanship, teamwork, dedication and perseverance.

Outstanding players are selected to form the Senior and Junior school teams. School team players&nbsp;are given extra training every Tuesday afternoon to ensure that they will be well-prepared for the&nbsp;annual East Zone Inter-Primary Schools Netball Championship which commences in March.&nbsp;Throughout the year, they will also be sent for various Netball carnivals where they will be exposed&nbsp;to friendly matches with Netball teams from other schools.
