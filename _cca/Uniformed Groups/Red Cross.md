As the only uniformed group in Eunos Primary, the Red Cross Link members stand out in their smart white uniform. We seek to develop our link members holistically by instilling in them the values of self-discipline, empathy and teamwork. Besides acquiring the Basic First Aid skills, members are also given numerous opportunities to level up their competencies and leadership capabilities such us participating in the National First Aid Championship. Members also actively participate in school events such as the National Day Observance Ceremony, Chinese New Year Celebration and Eunos Loves Gaia!, and go on enriching learning journeys to factories, museums and explore other places of interest.

We aim to inspire a positive change in others by our involvement in Values in Action (VIA) projects such as conducting beach cleaning activities and spreading awareness of Singapore Clean and Green movement through distributing self-made brochures to the public. To bring joy to our elderly residents at the nearby Senior Citizen Centres, we organise handicraft and Bingo game sessions to engage them meaningfully.

It has been a most rewarding journey for our members and we are honoured that many amongst them were awarded the prestigious Directorâ€™s Award for being well-rounded Red Cross Link members. Through a myriad of activities, we hope that our members will develop a desire for learning and a keen sense of duty and community to serve with compassion.
