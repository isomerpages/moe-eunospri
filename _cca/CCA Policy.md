### CCA Policy

Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) is an integral part of our studentsâ€™ holistic education. It develops students in specific knowledge, skills and values based on their choice of CCA and enables students to discover their interests and talents and provides common space for friendships and social integration.

At Eunos Primary School, all P3 to P6 students are required to participate in one CCA. Our school offers a range of CCAs in the domains of Aesthetics/Performing Arts, Sports, Uniformed Group and Clubs. CCA are conducted on Fridays, 7.30am to 9.30am.

We are committed to make CCA a meaningful experience for every student. In turn, we expect all students to take pride in their CCA and take responsibility for their learning in the CCA. We will not process any requests for changing CCAs unless in exceptional circumstances.

We will be recruiting new members for the following 8 CCAs in 2022:

| AESTHETICS/PERFORMING ARTS | SPORTS |
|---|---|
| - Choir | - Basketball (Boys Only) |
| - Cultural Dance | - Football (Boys Only) |
| - Art & Crafts |  - Wushu |
| **UNIFORMED GROUP** | **CLUBS** |
| - Red Cross |  - Robotics Club |
