Our Infocomm Technology (Media Production) CCA offers an exciting experience for students who have the interest in harnessing ICT tools which will be useful not only in their academic studies but also in their daily life applications. Students are taught how to use a DSLR camera, learn basic digital photography skills and employ Adobe Photoshop to refine and repackage their shots taken. Students will also have the exposure and training to do simple videography and animation using stop motion techniques.

Annually, our members get the opportunity to showcase their creativity at national level competitions such as 'National Photography Festival', 'Our Schools, Our Stories' Photo Competition etc. They get to integrate their photography and writing skills in producing interesting photo essays of selected topics. In addition, opportunities will be given to members to participate in national or school events as student photographers to gain exposure and experience.
