The Green Market was set up in 2016 as an important platform to spread awareness of the importance of conservation and preserving our natural resources. Being involved in environmental issues, the students study the interactions between components that affect nature, and how those relationships relate to green issues such as recycling and conservation. As such, The Green Market is now known as Environmental Science.

As resources are being depleted in a rapid manner, there is an urgency to ensure that there are sufficient resources for generations to come. We believe that it is everyone’s responsibility and all of us has a part to play in increasing our green efforts. Environmental Science aims to conserve the Earth’s resources by promoting sustainable “green” practices to the school and the community. The members will market exciting and interesting ways to help reduce, reuse and recycle waste. We also look into creating a more sustainable environment by growing and harvesting our own produce! The teachers and students are dedicated to heightening awareness about the fragility of our planet.
