**Our Focus:**
<br> The Eunos Primary School Robotics Club develops students into creative thinkers through challenges in the areas of coding and construction of robots.&nbsp;  
  
All students undergo a basic construction and programming course using the Lego Mindstorms NXT and EV3 sets. In addition, they are also exposed to other coding platforms like Scratch and micro:bits block editor. The club promotes teamwork as well, requiring pupils to work in teams to construct and program their robots.  
  
Students are exposed to various Zonal and National&nbsp;[competitions](https://staging.d1rxw6jlar8egk.amplifyapp.com/about-us/Achievements/CCA-achievements/)&nbsp;such as the National Coding Competition, Singapore Vex Robotics Competition and the East-Zone Robotics Challenge. These competitions allow students a platform to test their skills in problem solving by completing challenges set by these competitions.  
  
Our students have shown resilience and excellence by obtaining various awards in these National competitions over the years when faced with stiff competition.
